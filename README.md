# Fullstack Open Part 10 - Mobile Development with React Native

## Introduction

This repository contains my projects and exercises for Part 10 of the Fullstack Open course, focused on mobile development using React Native. The course covers a wide range of topics including setting up the development environment, building components, managing state, and integrating with backend services.

## Project Structure

Explain how your project is organized. For instance:

- `src/components`: This folder contains reusable components used throughout the app.
- `src/screens`: This folder contains the different screens of the app.
- `src/utils`: Utility functions and constants.
- `App.js`: The main entry point of the application.

## Technologies Used

- React Native: A framework for building native apps using React.
- Expo: An open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
- Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, used for managing state in the app.
- Other libraries: Mention any other libraries or tools used in the project.

## Setup and Running

Provide instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. For example:

1. Clone the repository:
